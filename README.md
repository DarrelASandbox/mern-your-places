## Notes

### ReactDOM.createPortal(child, container)

- Move overlay (e.g. SideDrawer.js) under <code>body</code>

### useEffect()

- Hooks are an important concept in modern React - they allow you to add various functionalities to functional components. And that's important: <b>Only to functional components.</b>

- <i>If you're building class-based components (which you also can), you can't use hooks - you got different APIs there.</i>

- <code>useState()</code> allowed us to register state which then is managed inside of a component. When state is changed, the component re-renders (or to be precise: It is re-evaluated and might lead to a re-rendering of the DOM).

- <code>useEffect()</code> does something different: It allows you to <b>register some logic</b> (i.e. a JS function) which will be executed when certain <b>dependencies</b> - which you define - change.
- Let's have a look at the <code>Map</code> example:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  const map = new window.google.maps.Map(mapRef.current, {
    center: center,
    zoom: zoom,
  });

  new window.google.maps.Marker({ position: center, map: map });
}, [center, zoom]);
```

- The logic here (i.e. the function) is to render a map + a marker on the map. The dependencies, that define when this logic should re-run, are our <code>center</code> and <code>zoom</code> variables. Whenever at least one of these two dependencies changes, the function re-runs. And that makes sense: If we got a new center or zoom level, we want to re-render the map!

- However, React does not track these dependencies behind the scenes. Instead, <code>useEffect()</code> re-evaluates the dependency values whenever the component in which you use <code>useEffect()</code> is re-evaluated (i.e. whenever the component's props or state changed).

- If the component is re-evaluated and the dependencies did NOT change, the logic in <code>useEffect()</code> won't run again.

- Important: The <code>useEffect()</code> logic re-runs <b>AFTER</b> the component (including its JSX code) was re-evaluated. That means, that the first execution of the <code>useEffect()</code> logic (when a component mounts for the first time) will <b>ALWAYS</b> happen <b>AFTER</b> the component rendered for the first time.

### Custom Hooks

- You can build a hook that uses other built-in hooks (like <code>useState()</code>) and any component that uses your hook will then use the built-in hooks you might be using in your custom hook as well.

- This allows you to build hooks like the <code>useForm()</code> hook we started to build in the previous lecture. The idea here is that we can share our stateful form logic (that uses <code>useReducer()</code> in our case) across components. This avoids code duplication, makes it easy to change the code and leads to more readable code.

- With all that "custom hook" jargon, it's easy to overlook that custom hooks in the end are normal JavaScript functions though - never forget that!

- If you use <code>useForm()</code> in your component function, it will get called for every re-evaluation of your component (i.e. for every re-render cycle). Hence all the logic in a custom hook runs every time your component function is executed.

- Of course a lot of built-in hooks like <code>useState()</code> or <code>useReducer()</code> have mechanisms to ensure that state changes are kept across re-render cycles.
